🧾 Simple Personal Expense Tracker (Python)

A beginner-friendly command-line expense tracker written in Python.
This simple program allows users to add, view, and delete personal expenses — all directly from the terminal.

🚀 Features

✅ Add new expenses with name and amount

📋 View a complete list of all recorded expenses

❌ Delete any expense by its list number

💰 Automatically calculates total spending

🧠 Simple and easy-to-understand code — perfect for Python beginners

🧩 How It Works

The program uses a list to store expense dictionaries (each containing a name and amount).
It provides a text-based menu with four main options:

Add Expense – Enter an expense name and amount.

Show All Expenses – View all expenses along with the total.

Delete Expense – Remove any expense by selecting its number.

Exit – Quit the program safely.
